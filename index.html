            <img src="images/CMCtutoringpic.jpg" alt="Me at a coffee shop" height="150px">

            <p>I am a full stack web developer living in Uptown Minneapolis, Minnesota. My background is academic, as I have recently attained a Master's degree in Mathematics at the University of Minnesota and am currently a Ph.D. candidate there. I also have a performing arts background, with experience both performing and teaching improv comedy. </p>

            <p>My interests as a developer range from the back end to the front end. I (would like to) design web applications that use principles from mathematics and statistics to retrieve and transfer information efficiently and faithfully. Additionally, I (would like to) design slick, responsive web pages for performing artists throughout the Twin Cities.</p>

            <p>Hobbies include comedy, theater, board gaming, video gaming, and karaoke!</p>
