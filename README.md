# HW2-Responsive-Portfolio
Basic Web Developer Portfolio for Programming Boot Camp

This is part 2 of Homework 2 from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. I have created a personal portfolio based on a given template. The site has three pages:

  - an "about me" page
  - a "portfolio" page
  - a "contact" page
  
Each page has media queries which change the layout of the container elements in response to resizing the screen. For large laptops (width 980 px), each page has the media present in two columns. For small laptops (width 768 px), each page has the media present in one column. For tablets (width 640 px), the header is presented in two rows instead of one row with the header left-justified and the navbar right-justified.
