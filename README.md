Basic Web Developer Portfolio for Programming Boot Camp

This is part 2 of Homework 2 from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. I have created a personal portfolio based on a given template. The site has three pages:

  - an "about me" page
  - a "portfolio" page
  - a "contact" page
