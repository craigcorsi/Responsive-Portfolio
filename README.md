# HW1-Portfolio
Basic Web Developer Portfolio for Programming Boot Camp

This is Homework 1 from the University of Minnesota Full Stack Web Development Boot Camp. I am creating a personal portfolio based on a given template. The site will have three pages:

  - an "about me" page
  - a "portfolio" page
  - a "contact" page
  
The site will follow design specifications specifying the color scheme, semantic structure, and font families. The site will be populated with information about my personal and professional interests.
